Jiawei yang,
Hancheng jiang;

Dear Sir,
we did a lot test and we found it gave different results each time, i think 
 it's because of the seeds which are used to deside hyperplains.
from the pictures you can see sometimes the result matches the test emais 
which are from data set 1-5.
However sometimes it's not accurate.I think it need some improvement,
please help to check.
One more problem is that sometimes it can read all emails in query folder
, some time is it missed some emails.

last,to run the code just cacell the comman for each part.

Thanks
